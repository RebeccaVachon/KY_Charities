# KY_Charities

## Purpose
This project will examine charities in the state of Kentucky using data from the IRS to see if there is a relationship between an organization’s subsector and its income. This project will also use Census data to see if there is a relationship between how well-funded an organization is and the median income of those who live in the same zip code as the organization. 

## Features

### Feature 1
Read TWO data files (JSON, CSV, Excel, etc.). 

### Feature 2
Clean your data and perform a pandas merge with your two data sets, then calculate some new values based on the new data set. 

### Feature 3
Make at least 1 Pandas pivot table and 1 matplotlib/seaborn plot. Pivot tables are a way to summarize your data and present it easily in a way that isn’t just a graph. They can be useful when combined with graphs.

### Feature 4
Utilize a virtual environment and include instructions in your README on how the user should set one up

### Feature 5
Annotate your code with markdown cells in Jupyter Notebook, write clear code comments, and have a well-written README.md. Tidy up your notebook, and make sure you don’t have any empty cells or incomplete cells that don’t do anything. Make sure it’s all functional before your final github commit.
